## Varying-intercept and varying-slope models

As seen below, intercepts, slopes or both can vary. The varying slopes are basically interactions between the indicator variable of the group and the continuous predictor. 

$$y_i = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta_{j[i]} x_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$y_i = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{j[i]} x_i + \epsilon_i$$
